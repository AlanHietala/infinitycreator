<h2 class="textheader">Print View Font Increased</h2>
 <div class="textblock">
<p>The print view font was a little small and made it hard to look up units quickly. It is now bigger so printouts should be much easier to read.

<h2 class="textheader">100 Active Accounts with over 800 lists</h2>
 <div class="textblock">
<p>infinity pool has just hit 100 active accounts and continues to grow at a rapid pace. There are also over 800 individual lists in the system now.</p>
<p>Given the number of people using the site regularly, would a rating and comment system make infinity pool better? You would be able to search by list size and faction, view the newest created lists, rate and leave comments</p>

<p> Mercenaries added to the system. You can now add both the mercenary army list type and mercenaries to regular army lists. Validation should occur properly availability will show as the non merc one in the list but it is calculated properly for valication reasons. I will fix the display issue in the next push.

	<p>Joan of Arc 2.0 and Nasmat remotes have been addded to the system. Joan 2.0 is fast, heavily armed and a general pain and the nasmat remotes are a cheap way for their operator to extend their visual range.</p>
