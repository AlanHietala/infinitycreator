<h2 class="textheader">June  15, 2009 Update</h2>
<div class="textblock">
<p> Mercenaries added to the system. You can now add both the mercenary army list type and mercenaries to regular army lists. Validation should occur properly availability will show as the non merc one in the list but it is calculated properly for valication reasons. I will fix the display issue in the next push.
